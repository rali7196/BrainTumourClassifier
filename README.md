# Brain Tumour Classifier

This is a web app that allows users to classify brain tumours on MRI images. In this repo, you will find the following:

1. The front end code (made using Next.js) 
2. The api microservice (made using Springboot)
3. The inference microservice (made using flask)
4. The machine learning training code (made using PyTorch)

With this project, I wanted to get a better understanding of how machine learning models can be incorporated into software engineering.
